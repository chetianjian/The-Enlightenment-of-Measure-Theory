# The-Enlightenment-of-Measure-Theory
These lecture notes (lec 1-3) are for MATH365 (Measure Theory and Probability) at the University of Liverpool, lectured by Dr. Alexey Piunovskiy. 
The directory also includes my personal understandings, thoughts and supplementary content.
Again, I want to show my gratefulness to Dr. Alexey Piunovskiy for providing me these original tex. materials.
